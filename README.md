# File_System_Organiser

We will be creating a File System Organizer

Features of the Project -

If you have numerous Files in a folder and they are not Properly arranged, you can use this tool to arrange them in specific directory 
according to their extension.

like text files will go into text File Folder 
.exe files will go into application folder and so on

so at the end you will have a arranged set of files in specific folders

grouping is on the following basis -
media: ["mp4", "mkv", "mp3"]
archives: ["zip", "7z", "rar", "tar", "gz", "ar", "iso", "xz"]
documents: [
      "docx",
      "doc",
      "pdf",
      "xlsx",
      "xls",
      "odt",
      "ods",
      "odp",
      "odg",
      "odf",
      "txt",
      "ps",
      "tex",
    ]
